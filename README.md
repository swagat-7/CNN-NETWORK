# CNN-NETWORK
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. The model is trained on a dataset of images (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR), with data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation all included in a clean and modular Jupyter notebook.
